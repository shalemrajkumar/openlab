### Decison tree

#### Overview

- Decision trees are simple ml_algorithm by asking binary quesions at the decision boundaries and created via reducing entropy of its leaves which directly reflects models confidence
- Classification and regression
-



#### Advantages

- Fast to predict and train, scaling as $$ O(mnlogn)$$ for learning and $O(logn)$ for prediction, where mm is the number of features and nn the number of observations : [[1](https://doi.org/10.3389/frai.2023.1124553)]
- Most interpretable
- Ability to handle numerical and categorical data without normalization with minimal preprocessing
-
