### ðŸš€  :`Openlab: Learn by Building`
"The best way to learn is to do."

This repository is a dynamic playground for hands-on coding experiments, inspired by the philosophy of learning through action. Dive into a curated collection of projects, algorithms, and creative challenges spanning diverse domains

Whether you're here to learn, teach, or simply geek out, letâ€™s turn curiosity into code.

#### ðŸ“‚  Whatâ€™s Inside?
- /projects â€“ Mini-apps & prototypes 
- /algorithms â€“ Classic & novel solutions
- /tutorials - Something i wanted to learn
- /sandbox â€“ Unfiltered experiments
- /surpriseme - i too don't really know its a random topic of choice by my ai assistants

**ðŸŒŸ  Code fearlessly. Learn relentlessly.**
