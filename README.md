"The best way to learn is to do."

This repository is a dynamic playground for hands-on coding experiments, inspired by the philosophy of learning through action. Dive into a curated collection of projects, algorithms, and creative challenges spanning diverse domains

Whether you're here to learn, teach, or simply geek out, let’s turn curiosity into code.

#### 📂  What’s Inside?
- /projects – Mini-apps & prototypes 
- /algorithms – Classic & novel solutions
- /tutorials - Something i wanted to learn
- /sandbox – Unfiltered experiments
- /surpriseme - i too don't really know its a random topic of choice by my ai assistants
